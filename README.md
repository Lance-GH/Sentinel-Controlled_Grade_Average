# Sentinel-Controlled_Grade_Average
A sentinel-controlled grade-average determiner

This little C program uses a sentinel value to escape a looping input scan from the command line and continously adds the input values to a 
total value that would have initially been set to zero. Finally, it divides the summed total by the number of inputs to calculate the average.
